  <p> With her powerful words and storytelling, Maya Angelou touched the hearts of people from all walks of life. 
    Her autobiographical book, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," is considered a modern classic, and her poetry collections, such as "And Still I Rise," resonate with strength, 
    resilience, and hope. My personal favorite of her collection is the book <i>"Letter to my Daughter"</i>, addressed to a daugther she never really had, but intended for female readers 
    around the world, the book is a compilation of many of Angelou's insightful life experiences from being a young girl - to travelling the world, all with something valuable to learn from.</p>
